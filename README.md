# Benchmarking_Classifiers_after_SVM-RFE
After SVM-RFE optimization and selecting the most important features (peptide-centric), following classifiers were trained using Monter-Carlo Cross-Validation (#100 iterations) and reported the accuracy score from validation dataset;
* Random Forest 

* XGBoost 

* ExtraTree 

* Logistic Regression (L1, Ridge regression) 

* Logistic Regression (L2, LASSO) 

* SVM (Linear Kernel) 

* SVM (RBF Kernel) 

* Gaussian Naive Bayes 

* Bagging
