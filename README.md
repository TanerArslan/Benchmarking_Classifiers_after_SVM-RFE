# Benchmarking_Classifiers_after_SVM-RFE
After SVM-RFE optimization and selecting the most important features (peptide-centric), following classifiers were trained using Monter-Carlo Cross-Validation and reported the accuracy score from validation dataset;
*Random Forest
*XGBoost
*ExtraTree
*Logistic Regression (L1, Ridge regression)
*Logistic Regression (L2, LASSO)
*SVM (Linear Kernel)
*SVM (RBF Kernel)
*Gaussian Naive Bayes
*Bagging
